# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
It is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintainance and evaluation of software. It differes from the traditional programming since taditional programming was mainly focusedon coding. Software engineering, however, encompasses broader activities such that leads to the development of  high-quality, reliable, maintainable, and scalable software systems.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Planning-it is where the scope, feasibility, purpose and obhjectives of the project are determined.
Requirement Analysis-The requirements of the software to be developed is gathered from stakeholders and analyzed.
Design-Focuses on architectural design of the software system to be developed.
Implementation (Coding)-It is where the actual coding takes place based on the developed architecture.
Testing-It involves verifying the functionalities of the software based on the reqiorements and identifying any defects that my have been missed during the development process.
Deployment-It is the release of the fully developed software to be used by the end-users.
Maintainance-It involves maintaining and updating the software after it has been deployed.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC must be completed before the next phase begins. It follows a top-down appraoch with minimal interation between the phases. The key features are that it is predicatble, documentation driven and sequential. Agile development model, on the other hand, is the model that applies iterative and incremental approach that promotes flexibility, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement throughout the software development process. It focuses on delivering small, functional pieces of the software through iterative cycles called sprints. The key fetures of agile development method is that it is iterative, flexible, allows for customer collaboration and requires minimal documentation.
Differences between agile and waterfall models
Waterfall model is sequentila while agile method is iterative
Waterfall model is fixed while agile method is dynamic
Waterfall model requires extensive documentation while agile method requires a small amount of documentation. 
Testing is done at the ende of waterfall model while in agile method it is a continous process


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements in the engineering design process.
It focuses on understanding and capturing what a system should do and the constraints under which it must operate. Requirements engineering aims to ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
It is the division of a software system into discrete, self-contained components or modules, each with a specific functionality.
It improves maintainability and scalability as changes in one module have minimal impact on other modules, making it easier to modify and update the system without causing widespread disruptions.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is the testing of individual components or modules of a software application in isolation to ensure that each part functions correctly.
 Integration testing involves combining individual units and testing them as a group to ensure that they work together correctly.
 System testing involves testing the complete and integrated software application to evaluate the systemâ€™s compliance with the specified requirements.
 Acceptance testing involves verifying that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end user.
 Testing is important as it ensures the software meets the specified requirements and works as expected, leading to a high-quality product.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools designed to manage changes to source code over time. They enable multiple developers to collaborate on a project by tracking individual changes, maintaining a history of those changes, and facilitating the merging of updates from different contributors.
Examples: Git, Subversion and Mercurial.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A Software Project Manager (SPM) plays a crucial role in the successful planning, execution, and completion of software projects. They are responsible for overseeing the project lifecycle, ensuring that objectives are met on time and within budget while maintaining quality standards.
Challenges: uncontrolled changes of project scope, limited resource, poor communication and poor risk management.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software Maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment. It ensures the software continues to meet user needs and operates efficiently over time.
Types: Corrective, adaptive, perfective and preventive maintainace.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ensuring the privacy and security of user data, respecting intellectual property rights, including software licenses and copyrights,creating algorithms that do not inadvertently reinforce biases and discrimination and ensuring that software decisions and operations are transparent and that there is accountability for their outcomes.
Software engineers can ensure that they adhere to the code of ethics by following established codes of ethics, such as those from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which provide guidelines for professional conduct.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
